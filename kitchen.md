# Clean up the kitchen

## Introduction

This document is a description
of my personal algorithm for cleaning up my kitchen.

I was inspired by a similar

in the excellent Overthinking Everything blog.

## Algorithm

* 🍽️  Stow away any clean and dry tableware
  from the drying rack and dishwasher.

* 🗑️  Are any garbage cans full?
  Empty them (take the bags away, place new bags).

* 🧹 Declutter: Is there any non-kitchen clutter in the counters?
  Return it to its usual place.

* If, while cooking, you dirty anything
  that doesn't go in the dishwasher (e.g., pots),
  leave it soaking in the sink.

* 🛒 After eating, bring into the kitchen
  all tableware and food from the dining room.

* 🥫 Handle food:

  * 🗑️  Not worth keeping? Trash it.

  * 🔥 Needs to cool down? Leave on the stove.

  * 🌡️  At room temperature? Store it.

* Sort dirty tableware into dishwasher and sink.
  If the sink is full,
  leave stuff in the counter next to it.

* Start the dishwasher under any of these conditions:
  * Some section is full
    (e.g., no more room for glasses).
  * Most items of a given kind are in the dishwasher
    (e.g., ~all forks are dirty).

* 🧽 Clean the counter next to the stove.
  This is mostly a superficial clean
  (no need for a thorough clean every day).

* 🫧 Wash everything in the sink.

  * Prefer to start with large items (e.g., pots).

  * Work in batches where you first soap many things
    before you start to rinse the soap away from them
    – you'll finish a batch when the soap begins to dry in some items.

  * Leave things to dry on drying rack or stove counter.

* 🧽 Clean the counter next to the sink.

* 🧽 Clean the sink.

## Principles

* Minimize context switches. 
  Context switches slow you down. 
  For example, minimize the number of times
  you have to:
  * Wash and/or dry your hands.
  * Open or close drawers or the dishwasher.

* Prioritize reducing in-flight work. 
  Think of the kitchen as a system
  with many subsystems. 
  Food and dirty utensils flow through these subsystems
  until they are properly put away. 
  As you reduce the number of items
  pending in each subsystem,
  you free capacity (e.g., more space in the drying rack),
  generally enabling other items to flow more efficiently.
