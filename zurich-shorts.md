Pastel crumbs on a brown mantle;
Spring returning to the forest
on the hills.

☙

Yet another purple flower shed by the magnolia
joins the mantle of yellow petals drying on the sidewalk.

☙

Paper thin walls.
The neighbor's early alarm crumpled my dreams.

☙

The red balloon finally breaks free
from the sticky fingers of the birthday boy,
only to get tangled in a magnolia tree.

☙

In the winter, an old lady throws breadcrumbs to the ducks.
She wishes her son called.

☙

The late snow finally melts
but the daffodils can no longer rise
to greet the sun.

☙

I walk over the bridge, clutching my umbrella tightly.
Plop!
The wind turns it into a useless antenna.

☙

Summer afternoon:
my refreshing Spritz arrived
with a wasp that won't leave.

☙

At the park the son walks backwards,
further and further and further away
from the ball he's about to kick.
