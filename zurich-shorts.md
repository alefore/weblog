Pastel crumbs on a brown mantle;
Spring returning to the forest
on the hills.

☙

Yet another purple flower shed by the magnolia
joins the mantle of yellow petals drying on the sidewalk.

☙

Paper thin walls.
The neighbor's early alarm crumpled my dreams.

☙

The red balloon finally breaks free
from the sticky fingers of the birthday boy,
only to get tangled in a magnolia tree.

☙

In the winter, an old lady throws breadcrumbs to the ducks.
She wishes her son called.

☙

The late snow finally melts
but the daffodils can no longer rise
to greet the sun.

☙

I walk over the bridge, clutching my umbrella tightly.
Plop!
The wind turns it into a useless antenna.

☙

Summer afternoon:
a swarms of wasps
dances around my Spritz.

☙

At the park the son walks backwards,
further and further and further away
from the ball.

☙

Old people at the flea market
weave an endless quilt
of patched-up half-forgotten stories.

☙

A furtive drop of ciocolatto nero
leaps from the ice cream cone
and kisses my white linen shirt.

☙

A beautiful stranger sleeps next to me.
Where am I?

☙

October.
Brown leaves soften the cobblestones.
