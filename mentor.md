# Mentoring

## Introduction

This document is a draft (as of 2024-05-20)
collecting my experiences with mentoring.

This is still a very early draft.
I'm publishing just to force myself to get it out there
and start polishing it,
but I expect it's still very incomplete.

This is written specifically for software engineers;
it may not translate well to other professions.

## What makes a mentor good?

The following are good characteristics for a mentor:

* Slight relative seniority.
  Obviously, your mentor will ideally be *more* senior than you
  –specifically, they will have tackled
  the types of problems you're trying to solve.
  But the key word is *slight*:
  ideally, they haven't already moved way past your current seniority.
  Concretely, they were solving problems of comparable scope
  *not so long ago*
  that they've already started to forget those experiences
  (as they have moved to accumulate experience solving larger problems).

* Theme fit.
  While, in my experience, some topics are very common,
  each mentorship may focus on different types of advice.
  You want a mentor that has experience
  on precisely the types of problems
  you are seeking to improve on.

* Available energy.
  This is perhaps obvious, but it bears saying explicitly:
  your mentor should have enough energy to dedicate to the mentorship.
  The actual time commitment isn't that large
  (I suggest roughly 1 hour per 3 weeks),
  but the mentor needs to be able to make the time and show up.

* Distance.
  A good mentor is often somewhat removed from the mentee,
  typically not in the same team.
  If the mentor and mentee share responsibilities,
  it may be difficult to discuss specific topics
  (for example, there may be conflicts of interest).
  This is perhaps less important than the other criteria.

## Rationale

### Why get a mentor?

Advancing in your career means expanding the scope of the problems you tackle,
taking larger responsibilities.
Problems are easier to solve
if you've tackled problems of the same type before.

The problems we're facing are only new variations of larger general problems.
A good mentor, who has solved them before, can help you from their experience.
They can help you direct your attention in directions you may be neglecting,
identify the right questions you should be asking.
Your mentor will *not* solve your problems for you,
but standing on their shoulders tends to significantly accelerate your success.

### Why mentor someone?

There are a few reasons why you should spend some energy mentoring others.

* You'll be fostering a culture of collaboration and sharing,
  helping others.

* You can have an outsized influence.
  A small investment of your energy (roughly an hour per month)
  can go a very long way:
  it can significantly accelerate the impact of someone else.
  You'll be in a very comfortable position
  of being able to guide projects or efforts significantly
  without taking either significant responsibilities
  nor being in charge of the actual execution.

* You'll learn:

  * Mentorships are a great opportunity to reflect.
    You'll be discussing types of problems you've faced recently.
    Forcing you to review and make explicit
    (so that you can transmit them to your mentee)
    the intuitions you built
    can help you dig deeper and consolidate knowledge.

  * They'll often suggest interesting ideas or approaches
    you hadn't considered.

* You'll be growing your network.
  Mentoring others is an excellent way to create long-term relationships.

Even if you don't get directly recognized,
you'll be guided by beauty.
Technical excellence is its own reward.

## Finding mentors

### Topics list

The first thing you should do to find a good mentor is
write down a list of three to five general questions
that frame the topics you would like to discuss.
This list will help everybody –including yourself– understand
the type of mentorship we're looking for.

They shouldn't be too specific
("how do I deal with a very specific situation")
but rather centered on engineering or leadership skills
that you'd like to improve on.


#### Examples

The following are a few example questions:

* How important is the phrasing in expectations/OKRs and evaluations?
  How much effort should we put into it?
  How do we get better at it?

* How do I strategize around positioning a product
  that's deeply integrated within Google's infrastructure?

* How do I build stronger relationships with partner teams, key customers,
  and senior leadership?

* As an engineering manager, how do I build technical credibility
  when I've been away from active coding for a very long time?

* How can I operate if my software has strong dependencies
  on components that don't work very well?

* How do I "sell" (to stakeholders, my management chain, etc.)
  the impact of the improvements I make to developer tools?

* How do I manage mid-size requests for help
  from my customers or other infrastructure teams?
  How much guidance should I provide?
  What's the story around recognition?

### Finding a good mentor

Email your list of questions,
to manager or tech-lead and ask them
to help you find someone to
mentor you on these topics.

Make it explicit:
you're not asking your manager or tech-lead to be your mentor.
You're already discussing things with them anyway.
Instead, you're asking them to help you find a third-party
who may fit your themes.

### Mentors for your teammates

Senior team leaders,
whether in tech-lead or manager roles,
should volunteer explicitly to help others find mentors.

Every year or two
I take ~ten minutes in our team meeting to:

1. Relate how much having a mentor has helped me.
2. Explain why everybody should consider having a mentor
3. Offer that anyone interested
   can simply email me and I'll do my best to find a good match.

When people take me up on this offer,
I ask them for the list of questions to help the search.
I forward their questions
–along with context about the applicant–
to other senior engineers in my network,
asking them if they can think of a good match in their organization.

## Structuring your mentorship

My advice for structuring a good mentorship:

* **1 hour.**
  Sometimes people schedule only 30 minutes;
  in my experience that's too short.
  You can always finish sooner if you run out of topics.
  More than 1 hour seems excessive.

* **Every 3 weeks.**
  * More frequent doesn't leave enough time between sessions
    to act on your mentor's feedback.
  * Less frequent causes you (especially the mentor)
    to start losing context from the previous conversation.

* **Prepare for each session.**

  * **Look back.**
    Start each session by explaining how you acted on the advice you received.
    What did you try?
    What happened?
    How did it work?
    That conveys to the mentor that you take their feedback seriously.

  * **Look ahead.**
    Aim to bring a new question to focus the conversation.
    Sometimes this will be an evolution of the previous questions.
    If this becomes difficult,
    you may agree with your mentor to end the program.

  * **Express gratitude.**
    Your mentor is taking energy to help you.
    Make sure you thank them for helping you advance faster in your career.

This may vary drastically depending on the type of mentorship,
the culture in your organization,
or your or your mentor's personal preferences.

## Be a good mentor

* Give space.
  Your mentee will have a different perspective to yours.
  Don't expect them to come to the same conclusions as you do.
  They'll know their specific context much better than you can,
  which may enable them to make better decisions
  (despite your relative seniority).
  Make sure you give them enough room to find their own voice.

* Focus on their growth,
  not on concrete problems or questions.
  The problems or questions being discussed are only tools
  to support their growth.
  You're only succeeding if they are building the ability to solve
  these problems independently.

  * Guide them by asking them questions, not giving them answers.

  * Give them time to think on their own.
    See if they come to similar conclusions to your own.

* Punctual.
  Show up on time to show respect and consideration.

## Conclusions

All engineers
should have a mentor
in order to accelerate their careers.
There are also concrete reasons
for senior engineers to contribute by mentoring others.

I hope the information in this document
gives you concrete ideas
to find a good mentor and structure your mentorship
in a way that sets you up for success.
