# Recommendations

This is a list of things or software programs
that I enjoy using.

## Why Share

I'm sharing this list for two reasons:

* Maybe it helps my friends or random readers get one or two useful ideas.

* I've benefited a lot from advice from my friends.
  I'm hoping my sharing this opening
  may encourage others to reach out to me
  with advice or suggestions:

  * You may be encouraged to write down and share a similar list
    of your favorite objects and recommendations.
    In this case, please send me an email (alefore@gmail.com)
    with a link to your list.
    I'd be happy to read it.

  * You may notice something missing or have an idea along the lines of
    "if you like X, you'll probably like Y".
    If you're one of my friends, please tell me next time we meet.

Goes without saying that this list is highly subjective.

## Software

### Excalidraw

I find Excalidraw excellent,
a great example of a good user interface.

As I was learning to use it,
I often found myself thinking
"oh, it would be great if I could adjust this object in this way,"
to just find out that the corresponding feature exists
and is accessible at the most natural place.

There's also a lesson to be learned at the fact that
the outputs are deliberately drawn imperfectly
(imitating a hand-drawn sketch).

### Syncthing

Syncthing very quickly became a critical part of my workflow,
allowing me to synchronize my Zettelkasten into various devices
much more efficiently than with other tools (including `git`) that I tried.

If you haven't heard of it, I recommend you check it out.
You may not need it yet,
but knowing about it may save you some time in the future.

### Git

I depend on `git` to maintain a lot of my information.

I can't say that git is an example of great design,
not when describing its user interface.
It sometimes seems more complex than merited.

On the other hand, I can't say that it isn't (an example of great design);
it may just be that my needs are relatively straightforward.

In any case, I love the flexibility and ease
with which it allows me to access and update
various repositories of information
across many devices.

## Furniture

### Aeron Miller

My personal chair is an Aeron Miller.

It doesn't look very pretty,
but I find it very comfortable.

### horgenglarus Classic

I own a set of horgenglarus Classic chairs.
While they are now a bit too old,
I'm very happy with them.

Originally designed in 1918,
they are still manufactured and sold,
with only minor variations.
These chairs not only
honor Swiss traditions and history
(and from the Sihl valley and Albis range) but also
exemplify great design.

## Home

# Sonos

# AeroPress

# Mud Australia

### Acaia Lunar

The Lunar scale is a pleasure to use.
I use it nearly every day (when making coffee) and it just gets the job done.
It's expensive, but it's one of those great examples of good design,
an object that just lets you achieve your goal and gets out of the way.

### Philips Hue Light Bulbs

We decided to upgrade _most_ light bulbs in our home to be smart light bulbs.
Great decision.

You can trivially reconfigure all your light switches
to accommodate requirements you hadn't (and couldn't have) anticipated.
I think there's something to be said about enabling iteration,
about adopting practices that let you more easily adjust your surroundings
to better fit your constantly evolving desires.
Christopher Alexander would say that you make your buildings come alive.

We went with the Philips Hue line,
on the recommendations from a friend.
It just works! We haven't had any issues.
I suppose other similar smart-light bulb systems may just as well;
I can't comment on how Philips Hue stands in comparison to their competitors.

I'm impressed by the fact that the technology has reached the point
where [a lightswitch](https://www.feller.ch/de/sortiment/schalter-und-taster/funktaster)
can communicate wirelessly
with the home control system
without needing any batteries or electric input
—the simple act of pressing it generates enough power.

We still have some old-fashioned light bulbs in our home.
Some are, unfortunately, not compatible;
for others (e.g., on very visible lamps)
we haven't found beautiful-enough bulbs in the Philips hue line.

## Clothing

### Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket

My Patagonia Better Sweater Fleece Jacket is the best sweater I've ever owned.
It's probably the sweater I've worn the most in my life.

I've not only worn it in mountain hikes or antarctic expeditions,
but many days in the office or home.
And, after almost a decade,
it's still pretty much in the same condition it was when I just got it.

I got it as a gift from Google.
The best piece of swag I've gotten.
Many of my colleagues who also got one are as appreciative of it as I am.

## Writing

### Pilot Vanishing Point

I write on paper using a Pilot Vanishing Point fountain pen.
I used it almost daily for journaling for a decade,
before I switched to a Pilot Custom 823 in 2024.

The pen has its fair share of scratches.
They bothered me in the beginning:
"oh no, it's scratched!"
I've now come to appreciate them.

### Topre Realforce Keyboard XF01T0

Since 2021-09, I do all my typing on a Topre Realforce XF01T0 keyboard.
It's a pleassure to use.

As of 2024-04-06, I haven't owned it for that long;
I don't know for how long it'll hold up.
But, until now, I haven't experienced any issues with it.
It works like a charm.

### Gmund hemp paper

My paper of chice is the
[Gmund 100% hemp paper (Gmund
Hanf)](https://www.gmund.com/shop/en_int/collections/gmund-hanf.html)
at 120 g/m² (in natural white, without colors).

## Baby

### Judes diapers

We decided to use reusable diapers for our baby
and went with the [Judes](https://www.judesfamily.com/) diapers.
We've only used them for about five weeks as of this writing,
but we're very happy with these choices.

These is highly subjective,
but sustainability considerations aside,
dressing our baby with these high-quality diapers
feels much better than using disposable diapers.
The difference is difficult to describe,
but it feels much more respectful of the baby.

A roll of poo paper lasts us about 3 weeks.
We got the Klassik-Set (including 21 diapers).

### Zipster

We really like the [Zipster pajamas](https://www.zipsterbaby.ch/):

* The bamboo fabric is great:
  it is very soft
  and breaths naturally.

* Having a zipper (rather than many buttons) is very practical
  –you'll appreciate this when changing diappers at 4 a.m..

If you're ordering them to Switzerland,
you'll have to pay customs on the import (Zollgebühr).

### Burp cloths

We have many burp cloths (Nuschi),
probably from six different manufacturers.
The quality differences are large.

The ones we like the most are:

* Lässig.
  Quite pretty designs and great quality (e.g., good absortion).

* Dear April.
  Probably the prettiest designs and great quality.
  On the minus, they have a special hem which we find somewhat annoying.

### Kalumi bodysuits

Of all the bodies we've tried,
the [Kalumi](https://kalumi.shop/en/collections/grow-free-with-me-body)
are our favorite.

Because they are made of Merino wool and silk,
they are quite stretchy (easy to put on)
and seem to keep our baby adequately warm.
