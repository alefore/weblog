Pastel crumbs on a brown mantle;
Spring returning to the forest
on the hills.

☙

Landing on the yellow petals on the sidewalk,
another purple flower, shed by the magnolia tree,
disappears.

☙

Paper thin walls.
The neighbor's early alarm crumpled my dreams.

☙

The bright balloon finally escapes
the clutch of the birthday boy,
only to get tangled in a magnolia tree.
