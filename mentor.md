# Mentoring

## Intro

This document is a draft (as of 2024-05-20)
collecting my experiences with mentoring.

This is still a very early draft.
I'm publishing just to force myself to get it out there
and start polishing it,
but I expect it's still very incomplete.

This is written specifically for software engineers;
it may not translate well to other professions.

## Good Mentors

What makes a good mentor?

* Slight relative seniority.
  Obviously, your mentor will ideally be *more* senior than you
  â€“specifically, they will have tackled
  the types of problems you're trying to solve.
  But the key word is *slight*:
  ideally, they haven't already moved way past your current seniority.
  Concretely, they were solving problems of comparable scope
  *not so long ago*
  that they've already started to forget those experiences
  (as they have moved to accumulate experience solving larger problems).

* Theme fit.
  Your mentor Good fit for the types of advice you seek.
  While, in my experience, some topics are very common,
  each mentorship may focus on different types of advice.
  You want a mentor that has experience
  on precisely the types of problems
  you are seeking to improve on.

* Available energy.
  This is perhaps obvious, but it bears saying:
  your mentor should have enough energy to dedicate to the mentorship.
  The actual time commitment isn't that large
  (I suggest roughly 1 hour per 3 weeks),
  but the mentor needs to be able to make the time and show up.

## Why

Advancing in your career means expanding the scope of the problems you tackle,
taking larger responsibilities.
Problems are easier to solve
if you've tackled problems of the same type before.

The problems we're facing are only new variations of larger general problems.
Others have solved the same types of problems before.
We can learn a lot from their experience.

A good mentor can help you from their experience,
to direct your attention in directions you may be neglecting.
This helps you reach insights significantly faster.
Your mentor will *not* solve your problems for you,
but standing on their shoulders tends to significantly accelerate your success.

## Kicking of mentorships

### List of questions

The first thing you should do to find a good mentor is
write down a list of three to five general questions
that you would like to discuss.
This list of topics helps everybody understand
what type of mentorship we're looking for.

### Finding a good mentor

Once you've written your list of questions,
email your manager or tech-lead and ask them
to help you find someone who may be able to help you
work through those topics.

You may want to make it explicit
that you're not asking *them* to be your mentor
(since you're already discussing things with them anyway),
but, instead, to help you find a third-party who may be a good match.

### Mentors for your teammates

If you are a senior leader in a team,
whether in a tech-lead or manager role,
you should volunteer explicitly to help your teammates find good mentors.

I do this every year or two:
I take ~five minutes in our team meeting
to:

1. Relate how much having a mentor has helped me.
2. Explain why I think everybody should have a mentor
3. Offer that anyone who wants to have a mentor
   can simply shoot me an email and I'll do my best to find a good match.

People often take advantage of this offer.
I ask them to write a list of questions,
which I then forward to other senior people in my network,
asking them if they can think of a good match.

## Structure

My advice for structuring a good mentorship:

* **1 hour.**
  Sometimes people schedule only 30 minutes;
  in my experience that's too short.
  You can always finish sooner if you run out of topics.

* **Every 3 weeks.**
  More frequent doesn't leave enough time to act on your mentor's feedback.
  Less frequent causes you (especially the mentor)
  to start losing context from the previous conversation.

* **Prepare for each session.**

  * **Look back.**
    Start each session by explaining how you acted on the advice you received.
    What did you try?
    What happened?
    How did it work?
    That conveys to the mentor that you take their feedback seriously.

  * **Look ahead.**
    Aim to bring a new question to focus the conversation.
    Sometimes this will be an evolution of the previous questions.
    If this becomes difficult,
    you may agree with your mentor to end the program.

  * **Express gratitude.**
    Your mentor is taking energy to help you.
    Make sure you thank them for helping you advance faster in your career.

Obviously, this may vary drastically depending on the type of mentorship,
the culture in your organization,
or personal preferences on your or your mentor's part.
