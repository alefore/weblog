Pastel crumbs on a brown mantle;
Spring returning to the forest
on the hills.

☙

Yet another purple flower shed by the magnolia
joins the mantle of yellow petals drying on the sidewalk.

☙

Paper thin walls.
Neighbor's early alarm crumpled my dreams.

☙

A red balloon finally escapes
sticky fingers of a birthday boy;
gets tangled in the branch of a magnolia.

☙

Old lady throws breadcrumbs at ducks.
Gray days.
Wishes her son called.

☙

The late snow finally melts
but the daffodils can no longer rise
to greet the sun.

☙

I walk over the bridge, clutching my umbrella tightly.
Plop!
The wind turns it into a useless antenna.

☙

Summer afternoon:
a swarm of wasps
dances around my Spritz.

☙

At the park. The son walks backwards,
further and further and further away
from the ball.

☙

Old people at the flea market
weave an endless quilt
of patched-up half-forgotten stories.

☙

A furtive drop of ciocolatto nero
leaps from the ice cream cone
and kisses my white linen shirt.

☙

A beautiful stranger sleeps next to me.
Where am I?

☙

October.
Brown leaves soften the cobblestones.

☙

Golden larches spell cold days ahead.
Nature prepares to rest.

☙

Blowing on yellowing birches,
Autumn waves with a thousand glittering hands.

☙

Doors flop open.
For an instant, dark and rainy outdoors
kiss the sanctuary inside the tram.

☙

Train station hall; little sister hums.
Gray walls absorb her joy.
Train teeth screech on steel.

☙

A sea of green leaves
grows around a window.
Inside, a library.

☙

Past demonstrations:
leaflets litter the tunnel under the tracks.
Young roller-skater soars past,
her long purple hair waving free,
dreams of a better future.

☙

After the rain.
A frightened puddle leaps away from a car,
finds refuge in my fluffy white scarf.

☙

Disruption.
Little bird,
bundle of feathers, bright yellow and gray,
lies on the sidewalk, dead.

☙

Triste November.
In the willows, shadows caw.

☙

Cyclist rushing along river
recognizes staring pedestrian
a second too late.

☙

Someone sorts cutlery in the kitchen.
Fresh waitress, very first day,
takes orders awkwardly.

☙

Saturday morning.
Wake up to the melody of trams
gliding by your window.

☙

Velo Promenade.
Packs of dry leaves bark hoarsely
under your tires.

☙

The concert finishes.
Drifting foreigners return slowly
from their far-away shores
into the November night.

☙

Ephemeral constellations under starless Autum skies:
fragments of yellow leaves on asphalt.

☙

Stars glow autumn red.

The setting sun retreats from the maple tree.

☙

Urban gladiator conquers metallic bull.
Light tap, hiss.
Elixir bleeds out of ashtray, perfect extraction, smooth.
Side of caramel biscuit.

☙

Look out the window, wife rushes down street.

Sip of coffee, tram nears station.

"You can make it, go, go, Go!"

☙

Der Wind nimmt die gelben Blätter des alten Ginkgo.

Frei wie Libellen fliegen sie davon.

☙

Wait at the bakery.
Somebody's baby studies you, tiny eyes, big cheeks, smiles at you.
Rays of sun break through the fog, melting snow feeds mountain springs.

☙

Las grandes hojas del abedul:
unas se van, fugaces, con el viento;
otras caen solas, dando vueltas en el aire frio.

☙

Sunny november afternoon.
Top floor suits negotiate next year's roadmap.
Big black bird flies east outside.

☙

12.10 Zürich → Luzern

"Letzte Fahrt von Joe Brunner nach 40 Jahren im Führerstand.
Alles Gute im Ruhestand!"

☙

Opera house.
Young girl holding a small nutcracker leans forward on her seat.

☙

Black branches of naked trees along river trail
admit the brightness of cloudy autumn skies.

☙

Icy winds lick dark streets;
glass membrane guards luminous flat filled with tropical plants and effervescent laughter.

☙

Gli aghi degli abeti in montagna abbracciano calmi i fiocchi di neve.
Niente ferma una valanga.

☙

Leise fällt der erste Schnee auf die alte Kastanie.

☙

Unbeirrt folgt das klapprige Tram der Strasse durch den Sturm.
Draussen wirbelt der Schnee.

☙

Te despierta un suspiro.
Cortinas abiertas.
La nieve ha llegado mientras dormían.

☙

Powdery snow, birches washed white.
On a twig, a twinkle: a yellow tit chirps.
Was it really there?

☙

Like prickly legs of a dried up bettle,
gnarly twigs in the naked chestnut
reach out to the cloudy sky.

☙

Silence becomes laughter;
kids sled down the hill,
smearing dirt over snow.

☙

Alegres gorriones cantan en un arbusto.
Me detengo a escuchar y se callan.

☙

La lluvia cesa;
ventanas se abren
al ruido de carros
en calles mojadas.

☙

En el cementerio
llueven ligeros
los graznidos
de los cuervos.

☙

Blossoms fair chance a final snow.
An old man, unsteady steps, a fall.
His crutches rest on the bench.

☙

Tarde lluviosa.
En la sala, nubes de hierbabuena.
Alguien timbra.

☙

A solitary leaf lands on the thick rug.
The living-room tree knows not of storms.

☙

Brutalism, dark shadows.
Raindrops fade on bare concrete.
Gray jungle breath.

☙

He savors a hearty brunch;
takes his time.

Sitting beside him,
feet dangling,
roller blades already on,
his daughter hums eagerly.

☙

She mumbles seven, ten words,
incomprehensible, yet joyful.

"I never remember,"
she says come morn,
"my dreams."

☙

After the rain,
blackbirds land heavy
on wet twigs above.
