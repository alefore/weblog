# Mentoring

## Intro

This document is a draft (as of 2024-05-20)
collecting my experiences with mentoring.

This is still a very early draft.
I'm publishing just to force myself to get it out there
and start polishing it,
but I expect it's still very incomplete.

This is written specifically for software engineers;
it may not translate well to other professions.

## Why

Advancing in your career means expanding the scope of the problems you tackle,
taking larger responsibilities.
Problems are easier to solve
if you've tackled problems of the same type before.

The problems we're facing are only new variations of larger general problems.
Others have solved the same types of problems before.
We can learn a lot/tr from their experience.

A good mentor will be someone that has tackled problems
of the same types as the problems you are facing.
This enables them to help you from their experience,
to direct your attention in directions you may be neglecting.
This helps you reach insights significantly faster.
Your mentor will *not* solve your problems for you,
but standing on their shoulders tends to significantly accelerate your success.

## Good Mentors

What makes a good mentor?

* Slightly more senior.
  Obviously, your mentor will ideally be more senior than you
  â€“specifically, they will be someone who has tackled
  the types of problems you're trying to solve.
  But the key word is *slightly*:
  ideally, your mentor has not already moved way past your current seniority.
  Concretely, this means they were solving problems of comparable scope
  not so long ago
  that they've already started to leave those experiences behind
  (as they have moved to accumulate experience solving larger problems).

* Topical fit.
  Your mentor Good fit for the types of advice you seek.
  While, in my experience, some topics are very common,
  each mentorship may focus on different types of advice.
  You want a mentor that has experience
  on precisely the types of problems
  you are seeking to improve on.

* Energy available.
  This is perhaps obvious, but it bears saying:
  your mentor should have enough energy to dedicate to the mentorship.
  The actual time commitment isn't that large
  (I suggest roughly 1 hour per 3 weeks),
  but the mentor needs to be able to make the time and show up.

## Pairing your teammates with mentors

If you are a senior leader in a team,
whether in a tech-lead or manager role,
you'll help your team if you find your teammates good mentors.

To do this, I encourage you to volunteer explicitly
to find mentors for your teammates.
I do this every year or two.
I take ~five minutes in our team meeting
to explain why I think everybody should have a mentor
and relate how much it has helped me.
I then offer that anyone who wants to have a mentor
can simply shoot me an email and I'll do my best to find a good match.
In this email, they must list three to five general questions
that they would like to discuss with a mentor.

People often take me on this offer.
I then forward this list to one or two other senior people in my network,
asking them if they can think of someone
who may be a good fit.
Having the list of topics
helps everybody understand what type of mentorship we're looking for.

## Finding a good mentor

If you'd like to find a good mentor,
I suggest you write down a short list of topics you'd like advice on,
as in the previous section.
You can then send an email to your manager or tech-lead and ask them
if they can think of someone who may be willing to help you
work on those topics.
You may want to make it explicit
that you're not asking *them* to be your mentor
(since you're already discussing things with them anyway),
but, instead, to help you find a third-party who may be a good match.

## Structure

My advice for structuring a good mentorship:

* **1 hour.**
  Sometimes people schedule only 30 minutes;
  in my experience that's too short.
  You can always finish sooner if you run out of topics.

* **Every 3 weeks.**
  More frequent doesn't leave enough time to act on your mentor's feedback.
  Less frequent causes you (especially the mentor)
  to start losing context from the previous conversation.

* **Prepare for each session.**

  * **Look back.**
    Start each session by explaining how you acted on the advice you received.
    What did you try?
    What happened?
    How did it work?
    That conveys to the mentor that you take their feedback seriously.

  * **Look ahead.**
    Aim to bring a new question to focus the conversation.
    Sometimes this will be an evolution of the previous questions.
    If this becomes difficult,
    you may agree with your mentor to end the program.

  * **Express gratitude.**
    Your mentor is taking energy to help you.
    Make sure you thank them for helping you advance faster in your career.

Obviously, this may vary drastically depending on the type of mentorship,
the culture in your organization,
or personal preferences on your or your mentor's part.
