# Synthetic aging

Artisans and manufacturers often synthetically age their products.
This article is an attempt to make sense of this trend.

This is an incomplete draft.
As of 2024-05-10, I still intend to augment and review it.

## Examples

* Ford uses speakers to digitally generate engine noise
  in new versions of Mustangs.

* A violin maker deliberately scratches new violins with pasta.

* Pieces of clothing are often deliberately worn out.

* Vinyl records rose again over digital formats.
  This isn't exactly synthetic aging,
  but as a deliberate preference for an old technology,
  is a closely-related phenomena.

## Reasons

Overt use of old objects conveys preferences for:

* Quality

* Exclusivity

* Minimalism

* Natural

* Respect for history

### Quality

Old objects that remain in use tend to convey a preference for quality.
These tend to be objects that were created with emphasis on quality,
in contrast to cheaply mass-produced modern objects.

In many markets, quality of products decays over time.
This reflects that many manufacturers
focus on reducing costs over increasing (or even maintaining) quality,
possibly in reaction to pressure towards short-term profits.
Objects become commodities and consumers may react more strongly
to price reductions –which are directly visible–
than to less tangible quality increases.
More manufacturers seem to be looking for cheaper materials
than for ways to deliver quality improvements.

The Lindy effect
–the life expectancy of technologies or ideas
is proportional to their current age–
also plays a role.
By synthetically aging objects,
manufacturers may be taking advantages of biases
borne by this effect.
Ironically, we may subconciously perceive these aged objects as more durable
–especially if we perceive them to be in a remarkably good shape
given how old they appear to be.

### Exclusivity

Old objects convey exclusivity.
They are more "authentic", "unique", or "original",
rather than mere copies.

They tend to be unique hand-crafted objects,
individual pieces laboriously created by artists (or artisans),
rather than mass-produced copies.

Each vynil record is unique,
rather than an identical digital copy.
The identical copies may be closer to the artist's vision
–free of the noise that makes the vynil unique–
but many still flock to the authentic experience of vynil records.

A mechanical camera exposes the negative,
chemically altering a piece of film irreversively.
In contrast, the images captured by a digital camera can be erased trivially,
with no incremental cost per photo.

### Minimalism

Old objects tend to reflect a rejection of ephemeral fads
and a focus on timeless, universal good design.

They were subject to whatever whims fashion catered to when they were created,
but they nevertheless tend to signal
a rejection of arbitrary and superfluous complexity.
That may reflect that time tends to accentuate the excentricites of fashion.

A design that is old and still produced is likely good;
else it wouldn't have survived.
The Lindy effect also applies here.

### Natural

Someone may prefer old objects to convey a preference for "natural" objects.

Natural ways (material, sources, manufacturing processes, technologies…)
have always been available,
whereas "artificial" or "synthetic" ways
are the invention of modern times.

Thus old objects are significantly more likely
to have been manufactured and operate
based on these traditional, natural ways.

### Respect for history

Use of old objects tends to signal an appreciation to our history
–depending on the nature of the object,
to our traditions, ancestors, origins.
The old object serves as a bridge to the past,
signaling connections from the owner to those who forged our history.

Old designs have had more time to influence society.
Having been used for a century,
horgenglarus chairs have become part of our collective consciousness.

Old individual objects have had more time to influence individuals.
Perhaps this old coat was worn by our ancestors and reminds us of them.
Even if the coat is synthetically aged (and thus new),
it implicitly suggests these possibilities.
