Pastel crumbs on a brown mantle;
Spring returning to the forest
on the hills.

☙

Yet another purple flower shed by the magnolia
joins the mantle of yellow petals drying on the sidewalk.

☙

Paper thin walls.
The neighbor's early alarm crumpled my dreams.

☙

The red balloon finally breaks free
from the sticky fingers of the birthday boy,
only to get tangled in a magnolia tree.

☙

Ducks fight for breadcrumbs an old lady throws them.
She wishes her son called more often.
