# Mentoring

## Introduction

This document is a draft (as of 2024-05-20)
collecting my experiences with mentoring.

This is still a very early draft.
I'm publishing just to force myself to get it out there
and start polishing it,
but I expect it's still very incomplete.

This is written specifically for software engineers;
it may not translate well to other professions.

## What makes a mentor good?

The following are good characteristics for a mentor:

* Slight relative seniority.
  Obviously, your mentor will ideally be *more* senior than you
  –specifically, they will have tackled
  the types of problems you're trying to solve.
  But the key word is *slight*:
  ideally, they haven't already moved way past your current seniority.
  Concretely, they were solving problems of comparable scope
  *not so long ago*
  that they've already started to forget those experiences
  (as they have moved to accumulate experience solving larger problems).

* Theme fit.
  While, in my experience, some topics are very common,
  each mentorship may focus on different types of advice.
  You want a mentor that has experience
  on precisely the types of problems
  you are seeking to improve on.

* Available energy.
  This is perhaps obvious, but it bears saying explicitly:
  your mentor should have enough energy to dedicate to the mentorship.
  The actual time commitment isn't that large
  (I suggest roughly 1 hour per 3 weeks),
  but the mentor needs to be able to make the time and show up.

## Why get a mentor?

Advancing in your career means expanding the scope of the problems you tackle,
taking larger responsibilities.
Problems are easier to solve
if you've tackled problems of the same type before.

The problems we're facing are only new variations of larger general problems.
A good mentor, who has solved them before, can help you from their experience.
They can help you direct your attention in directions you may be neglecting,
identify the right questions you should be asking.
Your mentor will *not* solve your problems for you,
but standing on their shoulders tends to significantly accelerate your success.

## Finding mentors

### List of questions

The first thing you should do to find a good mentor is
write down a list of three to five general questions
that you would like to discuss.
This list of topics helps everybody understand
the type of mentorship we're looking for.

### Finding a good mentor

Email your list of questions,
to manager or tech-lead and ask them
to help you find someone to
mentor you on these topics.

Make it explicit:
you're not asking your manager or tech-lead to be your mentor.
You're already discussing things with them anyway.
Instead, you're asking them to help you find a third-party
who may fit your themes.

### Mentors for your teammates

Senior team leaders,
whether in tech-lead or manager roles,
should volunteer explicitly to help others find mentors.

Every year or two
I take ~ten minutes in our team meeting to:

1. Relate how much having a mentor has helped me.
2. Explain why everybody should consider having a mentor
3. Offer that anyone interested
   can simply email me and I'll do my best to find a good match.

When people take me up on this offer,
I ask them for the list of questions to help the search.
I forward their questions
–along with context about the applicant–
to other senior engineers in my network,
asking them if they can think of a good match in their organization.

## Structuring your mentorship

My advice for structuring a good mentorship:

* **1 hour.**
  Sometimes people schedule only 30 minutes;
  in my experience that's too short.
  You can always finish sooner if you run out of topics.
  More than 1 hour seems excessive.

* **Every 3 weeks.**
  * More frequent doesn't leave enough time between sessions
    to act on your mentor's feedback.
  * Less frequent causes you (especially the mentor)
    to start losing context from the previous conversation.

* **Prepare for each session.**

  * **Look back.**
    Start each session by explaining how you acted on the advice you received.
    What did you try?
    What happened?
    How did it work?
    That conveys to the mentor that you take their feedback seriously.

  * **Look ahead.**
    Aim to bring a new question to focus the conversation.
    Sometimes this will be an evolution of the previous questions.
    If this becomes difficult,
    you may agree with your mentor to end the program.

  * **Express gratitude.**
    Your mentor is taking energy to help you.
    Make sure you thank them for helping you advance faster in your career.

This may vary drastically depending on the type of mentorship,
the culture in your organization,
or your or your mentor's personal preferences.

## Conclusions

I strongly encourage all engineers that want to continue growing
to have at least one active mentorship.

I hope the information in this document gives you concrete ideas
to find a good mentor and structure your mentorship
in a way that sets you up for success.
